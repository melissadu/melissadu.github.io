&lt;p&gt;When I’m upset, I like to be alone. I don’t like to feel that I’m burdening other people with my emotions. I scare myself when I cry, and there are very few people in this world I would ever cry in front of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never screamed or yelled at another person. The most I’ve done is raise my voice a couple of decibels above my usual tone, which wasn’t too loud to begin with anyways. Maybe it’s the Asian in me, but when I’m overwhelmed with negative emotion, I always prefer to process those feelings alone first and only with others once the initial wave of negativity has passed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For better or for worse, when it comes to anger and negative emotions my boyfriend is the exact opposite of me. He wears his feelings loudly and proudly, hiding nothing. He yells when he’s upset, and because he doesn’t like to simmer or let bad feelings linger, he prefers to resolve things in the heat of the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s not surprising, then, how difficult fighting with each other is. When conflicts between us arise, I retreat. He advances. I’ve accused him of being overly sensitive. He’s accused me of being emotionally unaware. It’s more important for me to be right. It’s more important for him to feel good about everything again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think this is true for most advice but especially true when it comes to relationships: advice is almost always too generic and therefore worthless because it’s only fun to give but really difficult to actually put into practice. Every situation is different, and every emotion is infinitely complex. It’s rather amusing to think a platitude like “&lt;a href=&quot;https://time.com/5402188/how-to-fight-healthy-partner/&quot;&gt;be curious about your fights&lt;/a&gt;” might ever be useful when you’re actually in the middle of one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fights between the two of us are usually resolved with some sort of compromise. But compromise seems to imply that both parties have to give something up. What happens when that “something” you give up feels core to who you are? Can compromise in a relationship be possible without changing fundamental aspects of yourself? People like to say they want to be in a relationship that challenges them to change and grow in ways they never thought possible. Maybe those people have never been in relationships before. Maybe what people really want are relationships that only amplify the parts of themselves they already know are great.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once I was in a car on the way back from Tahoe with my boyfriend, my brother, and my friend Derrick. The drive was about five hours and to pass the time Derrick challenged us all with a riddle. My boyfriend and I then spent the rest of the car ride — yes, all five hours — fighting about the riddle. The worst part is that neither of us even remember what the fight was about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In retrospect, that fight is a great example of something both of us should have just let go. If I were a perfect person, then I’d only fight if the fight were about values or morals I’m not able to budge on. I don’t have many of those values; they’re called core values for a reason, after all. I can and should be willing to compromise on everything else. The hard part about relationships most people don’t realize is that relationships are actually all about compromise, because guess what: the chances that there exists another person in the world who perfectly fulfills every single one of your criteria, who never expresses any desires or beliefs that are in conflict with yours, and who you happen to meet (out of the 7 billion people other people in this world!) at just the right time for a relationship to start are…you guessed it, zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been three years since we started dating and we’re still learning how to compromise. For now, I remind myself that every fight between the two of us is an active choice. I expect we’ll be learning for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, my friend Patricia sent this quote to me and I haven’t been able to get it out of my mind since. It concludes these thoughts much better than I could ever hope to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“People said ‘treat your lovers like friends and your friends like lovers.’ we have a lot more expectations of lovers…and sometimes we forget to have fun and just really enjoy the time we have together. we can be really harsh toward lovers, perhaps because we feel so vulnerable. that’s where we need to be better friends to our lovers. with friends we’re more likely to cut them some slack, to let things be a little more fluid. no big deal if they’re late, or miss a hang-out once in a while, for example.”&lt;/p&gt;

Like transient dreams, my rabbit-hole escapades are usually quickly forgotten, but today I found myself mulling over a lot of what I had read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rabbit hole began with &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/cwervo/status/1260411312921772034&quot;&gt;this tweet&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;img style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/rabbit-hole-tweet.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was really fascinated by these niche research papers, but began dozing off after skimming through a few of them. I wasn’t ready to fall asleep, though, and these Wii papers had put me in a mood to have my mind blown by interesting research experiments. So I decided to search for some psychology studies and stumbled across Dr. Rosenhan’s 1973 research paper, &lt;a href=&quot;http://psychrights.org/articles/rosenham.htm&quot;&gt;On Being Sane in Insane Places&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-being-sane-in-insane-places&quot;&gt;On being sane in insane places&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/insane.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was unsettled by this study. In it, Dr. Rosenhan empirically questions exactly what makes a person “insane” and conducts an experiment in which “eight sane people gain secret admission to 12 different hospitals.” He studies how each of those people are treated and details the circumstances in which they’re discharged. Shockingly, all of the patients (who, mind you, are sane!) were discharged with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, and the average length of their stay — before demonstrating to the hospitals they were well enough to be released — was 19 days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This study made me start thinking about the trust we ascribe to labels, the stigma associated with those labels (in the case of this study, the particularly negative and detrimental associations of a schizophrenic diagnosis), and the organizations that hand out those labels. As my mind started wandering towards the topic of trust, I was reminded of a show, Golden Balls, that I think is one of the quickest and most exciting spectacles of trust and psychology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;golden-balls&quot;&gt;Golden Balls&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img style=&quot;width: 30%;&quot; src=&quot;/imgs/golden-balls.png&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=golden+balls&quot;&gt;Golden Balls is a game show&lt;/a&gt; that aired from 2007-2009 and an exciting demonstration of the Prisoner’s Dilemma in action. I watched a few highlights on YouTube and got so excited about the psychology behind the show that I wanted a refresher on the Prisoner’s Dilemma.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I began searching for a good refresher that didn’t include any academic or economic professor jargon and stumbled onto this incredible, 30-minute online game that perfectly and beautifully broke down the Prisoner’s Dilemma in intricate detail and engaging animations: &lt;a href=&quot;https://ncase.me/trust/&quot;&gt;https://ncase.me/trust/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It had been a while since I was so engrossed with and impressed by an online game. I immediately wanted to know more about its creator, Nicky Case, and spent a while perusing his blog. I was particularly struck by his blog post, &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.ncase.me/2010-2019/&quot;&gt;https://blog.ncase.me/2010-2019/&lt;/a&gt;, which detailed his journey as a creator over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That post then reminded me of a fleeting detail I remembered about how Kanye West began school but then dropped out because school took away too much time from his music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;college-dropout&quot;&gt;College Dropout&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I remembered that detail about Kanye, I obviously had to go to &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanye_West&quot;&gt;his Wikipedia page&lt;/a&gt; to confirm if I had remembered correctly (I did!). I experienced a brief surge of inspiration as I admiringly read how Kanye’s work and artistic career evolved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That brief surge of inspiration reminded me of the last time I experienced a similar feeling, which was when I was watching &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uc-JxJFxxUA&quot;&gt;Justin Bieber’s YouTube documentary&lt;/a&gt; (no shame).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After I thought about Justin Bieber, I remembered &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gq.com/story/justin-bieber-gq-interview&quot;&gt;a GQ profile on Justin Bieber&lt;/a&gt; I had bookmarked a while back, which was written in 2016. I opened it up and read it, and the profile was absolutely enthralling (huge kudos to the journalist, Caity Weaver, who wrote it). It’s quite rare to read such a humanizing depiction of a person as famous as Justin Bieber. Here’s an example of what I mean:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Justin Bieber is not easy to talk to. A linguist would say he violates backchannel norms. That is, he withholds those subtle signs—short verbal cues like “mmm-hmm,” “right,” and “yeah”; quick head nods—that indicate an engaged listener and that encourage the speaker to continue. You perform these signs countless times a day; it’s something humans do whether they speak English, Hungarian, or Farsi.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I opened up Twitter to see if Justin Bieber had tweeted anything interesting recently. But at this point, it was already past 3am and it was then that I finally fell asleep.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I thought I’d share the rabbit hole my restless, sleep-addled brain took me down on the Internet last night.

Unfortunately, Twitter’s default user experience sucks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t necessarily blame them. Twitter is an ad-driven business and as such, they employ thousands of engineers, marketers, and product people to build an experience that ensures you stay on Twitter for as long as possible and click on as many ads as possible. But if you want to curate your newsfeed so that you get what &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; want out of Twitter and not what some product manager decided you should want from Twitter, then read on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;default-experiences-suck&quot;&gt;Default experiences suck&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are three reasons why Twitter’s default experience sucks:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;“Likes” are very weak indicators of tweets that I might find interesting&lt;/strong&gt;, yet other people’s “liked” tweets take up such a big part of my Twitter timeline. There are a few reasons why seeing so many “liked” tweets is annoying:&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;First, people like tweets for all sorts of reasons: to promote causes they believe in, to support their friends, to indicate they thought the tweet was funny, etc. But since I don’t actually know (or don’t know that well) most of the people I follow, all of that signal just becomes noise on my timeline since I only really care about what ~20 of my close friends like and care about.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;Second, and more importantly, way more people “like” tweets instead of write them (&lt;em&gt;See the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_Internet_culture&quot;&gt;1% rule&lt;/a&gt;, which posits that in Internet communities, 99% of users lurk while only 1% of users add content&lt;/em&gt;). Because “liking” is such low stakes, easy behavior, there’s no skin in the game for the person who liked the tweet. (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2017/09/12/after-tedcruz-liked-a-porn-tweet-sen-ted-cruz-blamed-a-staffing-issue/&quot;&gt;Like Ted Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, you can easily create plausible deniability by claiming you “mistakenly” liked a problematic tweet.) Thus, unlike retweets or actual tweets, liked tweets are really bad approximations for ideas the person actually believes in and would stand behind.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The timeline encourages positive reinforcement that quickly sucks you into echo chambers.&lt;/strong&gt; I follow my friends, and as a 24 year old living in the Bay Area, unsurprisingly a lot of my friends work in tech. Before I know it, all of my suggested tweets and accounts to follow are from others who work in tech, and suddenly my default timeline has become VC twitter. I don’t &lt;em&gt;care&lt;/em&gt; that every VC has suddenly started using Clubhouse, thank you very much.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The default experience is built to be a distracting, mindless rabbit hole&lt;/strong&gt;. Twitter encourages you to spend as much time as possible on their site in ways that are difficult to avoid, as much as the ideal version of yourself says that you don’t care. They’ve objectively built a very addicting experience (see my point above about them being an ad-driven business), so if you come to Twitter to accomplish a small task for a productive purpose, it won’t be surprising if awhile later you’ve entered some rabbit hole and are still mindlessly scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;optimizing-your-twitter-experience&quot;&gt;Optimizing your Twitter experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Use Lists to only add people you want to see tweets from.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completely remove your default timeline by using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tweetdeck.twitter.com&quot;&gt;Tweetdeck&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;, which allows you to customize your Twitter experience. Some side benefits: Tweetdeck is ad-free, so you will no longer have Promoted Tweets clogging up your timeline, and the tweets show up in reverse chronological order, so you don’t have to see what Twitter’s algorithms have decided are top tweets for you!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In Tweetdeck, add the lists you’ve created in Step 1 as your default view instead of the timeline.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Optional:&lt;/em&gt; Generously block and un-block keywords. I jump back and forth between how I feel on this one. Sometimes I think the “mute keywords” feature will lead to a dystopian future in which everyone builds their own social-media echo chambers and only read tweets that are in line with their own beliefs. Other times I think the muting feature is great because then you don’t have to get annoyed by seeing the 100th tweet about something you’ve already read ad nauseum about.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a cyclist, I’m in a constant battle with drivers. I dangerously skid into the car lane when careless Uber drivers pull in front of me on Valencia to drop off passengers. I squeeze my brakes as hard as I can when yet another car cuts me off to quickly turn right at an intersection. And when I pedal down a crowded street…I can only hope that the drivers are thoughtful enough to look twice before swerving into the sad, unprotected bicycle lane.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The worst streets to bike on are the poorly kept ones. There are two types of poorly kept roads: the ones that are perpetually under construction, and the ones that are littered with broken glass and trash. Both are tricky, but in different ways: the former requires you to tenaciously pedal next to deafeningly loud construction vehicles as they pump smoky exhaust in your face, and the latter requires you to magically learn to have one eye looking ahead and the other eye scanning the ground so that you can avoid riding over the remains of shattered car windows and not get killed in the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this isn’t a rant against San Francisco, or biking — in fact, quite the opposite. When I’m on a bicycle, I accelerate through the small San Francisco neighborhoods as if I’m watching a lecture video on 2x speed. One second I’m huffing and puffing up the hills of Noe Valley and the next I’m surfing through the Mission with dozens of other bikers, skateboarders, scooters, and whatever new “last mile” mobility device that is now cramming itself into the bike lanes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best part about biking in San Francisco? The Golden Gate Bridge and its beautiful unpredictability. One day I cross the bridge enshrouded in fog and covered in goosebumps from the slap of the wind against my skin, and the next I coast across it in a slick layer of sweat from the sun powerfully beaming down. On the sunniest days, biking across the bridge feels like flying above the most beautiful planet on the most beautiful part of the Earth; on the cloudiest days I have nothing but the loud blare of the ferry fog horn to serve as my north star.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">My fondest memories of San Francisco are the ones I experience on my bicycle as I’m shuttling myself through the sometimes busy, always dirty streets of the city.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">A small life update</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/09/24/a-small-life-update.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="A small life update" /><published>2019-09-24T01:14:00-07:00</published><updated>2019-09-24T01:14:00-07:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/09/24/a-small-life-update</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/09/24/a-small-life-update.html">&lt;p&gt;I quit my first full-time job three weeks ago to start a company. At the time this felt like a really monumental decision but now, looking backwards, it wasn’t really that big of a deal. I’m more convinced than ever that, at this stage of my life, time is the most important thing to optimize for and that it pays off in dividends to be thoughtful about where and how my time is spent. Me quitting my job was a deliberate choice to dedicate my time solely around my goals and my growth. I’m thankful to have savings from my past jobs and internships to keep me going for a bit and for friends and family who are always a great source of support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always lived my life in a (relatively) linear fashion: in high school, I worked hard to get into the best college possible. In college, I worked hard to get the best internships and first job possible. In my first job, I worked hard towards the promotions that everyone else was working for. In all of these instances I’ve constructed my work around what others found important. In the absence of strongly held values of my own, it was all too easy to adopt the desires of others around me. Now, out of a stubborn desire to chase solely what I want to, I’ve decided to forge my own path. After all, we only get a limited amount of time to build the world that we want to live in ;-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so, for the first time, what’s next for me isn’t so clear. Progress on my company isn’t linear, so I take each day one at a time. In a funny way, it kind of feels like working on a massive assignment for a CS class: in just ten minutes I could set back all the progress I’ve made in the past ten hours by discovering some flaw in the logic. Case in point - just last week I felt like I discovered the one idea to end all ideas, and then the next week I talked to a few more people and discovered that what I thought was a huge problem wasn’t actually a big deal at all. Reflecting on my own pain points and experiences has been a helpful way to re-orient myself in times of confusion, especially when I talk to two people who experience the same problem but say completely different things about it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So…yeah. This is my life right now, and while it’s definitely not all roses (yes, it’s often lonely and yes, I’m often frustrated and lost and confused), I couldn’t be happier about it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">I quit my first full-time job three weeks ago to start a company.

&lt;p&gt;In this post:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#996&quot;&gt;996&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#edtech&quot;&gt;Education Technology&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#chuangye&quot;&gt;Entrepreneurship Road&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#logistics&quot;&gt;Logistics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#wechat&quot;&gt;WeChat (of course)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#people&quot;&gt;The absurd number of people&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#photos&quot;&gt;Some photos, just for fun 🙂&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beijing is currently one of three major tech hotspots in China (the other two being Shanghai and Shenzhen) and houses some of the world’s most valuable start-ups such as Baidu, Didi, and Meituan. More than 1/3 of all VC deals in China are made in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time Beijing is one of the oldest cities in the world. It’s been the capital of China for more than 3,000 years and houses some of the world’s most important historical wonders — the Great Wall, the Forbidden City, Tiananmen Square — as well as two of the best universities in all of China — Tsinghua and Peking University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So to say Beijing is an important place in the world would be an understatement. The tech scene in Beijing (but also the rest of China) has been developing rapidly in the past ten years and even more so in the past few. The below are some notes on what I observed during my time there in June 2019.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;996&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;996&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People in China work &lt;em&gt;hard&lt;/em&gt;. The typical worker embodies a working culture dubbed “996”: nine AM to nine PM, six days a week. This is the expectation amongst young people entering the tech workforce and has been established as the norm by leaders such as Jack Ma (CEO of Alibaba) and companies such as JD.com (an e-commerce company worth about 68B USD).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve read about a lot of backlash to 996 online, the young people that I met were quite accepting of the 996 work culture (granted, this may also have been sample selection bias). They acknowledged the difficulties but also knew 996 culture was expected and were willing to put in the efforts required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;edtech&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Education Technology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the exponential rise of companies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.vipkid.com&quot;&gt;VIPKid&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zuoyebang.com&quot;&gt;Zuoyebang&lt;/a&gt; in the past two years, education technology seems to be a hot area for Chinese start-ups right now. New online platforms are taking advantage of high-quality video-conferencing technologies to instantly connect students with teachers and are going head-to-head with more traditional industry leaders such as New Oriental, which currently has a market cap of about $16B USD.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clearly what hasn’t changed is Chinese people’s willingness to spend their discretionary income on K-12 education, probably in large part due to the rigor imposed by the gaokao (高考) system. Newer startups in the education technology area are now finding ways to apply AI to adaptively teach children skills across a variety of different areas like English, music, and coding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;chuangye&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Entrepreneurship Road&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, there is literally a road in the middle of Zhongguancun (the neighborhood in Beijing where most startups and VCs are located) called Entrepreneurship Road (创业路). The various people I reached out to when there were all very excited to meet and exchange ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For some odd reason I had this mistaken belief that the way startup offices look/feel are unique to Silicon Valley…but it as turns out the startup offices in Beijing look just the way they do here in the Bay Area. 😂 There’s also plenty of WeWorks around Beijing as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;logistics&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Logistics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logistics network in China is incredibly developed, much more so than here in the US. I think a significant barrier in the States is that labor is expensive, so ordering food on DoorDash feels like a luxury that isn’t even worth it since delivery fees can be around $10 and the waiting time is usually almost an hour.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in China labor is cheap and abundant, and the logistics network makes everything instantaneous. Food ordered on an app arrives instantly, and even beyond food you can instantly order literally &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt; your heart desires straight to your home: a haircut, cleaning services, an art teacher, sliced fruit…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, just for fun, here’s a photo of some workers I saw organizing packages for delivery on the side of the road. I’m not sure if this is the usual workflow for sorting packages, but I thought it was interesting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;centered-img&quot; src=&quot;../../../imgs/packages.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;wechat&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;WeChat (of course)&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any post on China would be incomplete without a mention of WeChat. This time, though, I learned a few new things about WeChat I didn’t know before:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WeChat Mini Programs are apps that exist within the WeChat ecosystem. This allows you to accomplish almost everything you could ever need your mobile phone to do without ever having to leave WeChat.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of restaurant’s menus are being replaced by WeChat. Each table is equipped with a QR code, and your food will arrive within a few minutes after scanning the code and placing your order within the restaurant’s WeChat Mini Program.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WeChat only lets you view first-degree connections among your network. Social networks here in the States have popularized the idea of a 2nd-degree network so much that I’ve taken it to be the norm (Facebook’s mutual friends, Twitter’s “Followers you may know”, etc), but WeChat is a completely locked down environment. You can’t request to join any WeChat groups you’re not already a part of, and you can’t add anyone unless you know their phone number or WeChat ID.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The absurd number of people&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t ever really get used to just how many people there are in China. Rush hour on the trains/buses is insane, and Beijing traffic seems to be bad at all hours of the day. If you thought waiting in line for brunch in San Francisco was bad, here is a photo of the line (at a non-rush hour time) at HeyTea, a very popular tea spot in China:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&quot;centered-img&quot; src=&quot;../../../imgs/heytea.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some photos of a crowd of people waiting to watch the flags being lowered at Tiananmen Square:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;

&lt;a name=&quot;photos&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;strong&gt;And finally, some photos of some delicious food I had in Beijing, just for fun…&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hard skills can be used by the individual who possesses them to actually produce something, such as a mathematical model predicting snowfall in a certain region or a piece of software to analyze restaurant orders. Because hard skills are quantifiable (I can weld X horseshoes in Y amount of time), development of one’s hard skills is also quantifiable (this year I can weld Z% more horseshoes than I did last year).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One’s hard skills can only truly be appreciated and evaluated by others who also possess those same hard skills, since only other people who have also spent years training and developing those same hard skills can really understand the legitimacy of that person’s contributions. Crucially, this means that most people cannot properly evaluate “hard” skill contributions. While anyone is able to evaluate the final product created, only a select few — those other people with the same hard skills — will deeply understand the technical effort, breakthroughs, and progress made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means that there is a gap between individuals who possess hard skills and everyone else. Soft skills are what can be used by individuals who possess hard skills to bridge that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike hard skills, soft skills can’t actually be used to create anything. You cannot write a piece of code by being persuasive or build a table by being charismatic. Soft skills are qualitative and vary from person to person. Whereas not everyone possesses hard skills, everyone possesses soft skills. This means that the barrier to entry for feeling like an expert with regards to soft skills is quite low or even non-existent: everyone feels that they know how to judge and evaluate other people, and everyone feels like their judgements and evaluations are correct (at least to some degree). Many people, such as VCs/other investors, even make a living from evaluating other people’s soft skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The true value of soft skills lies in the fact that they can be used to motivate others who have hard skills to create and build things they would not have otherwise. I call this the “ability to sell”. The ability to sell is the ability that contributes most to a person’s success and yet is one of the most under-valued skills in Silicon Valley.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people in Silicon Valley are highly technical and are not interested in developing the skill of selling. Because the barrier to entry is seen as too low (anyone can sell things, but not anyone can write a highly complex piece of software), most technical people simply aren’t interested. Technically difficult problems with high barriers to entry are much more alluring to people with hard skills, especially since they had to work for years to get to a point where they could even solve those problems in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All this to say: the most valuable skill one can possess, especially in a highly technical environment like Silicon Valley, is the ability to sell another person something*. The greatest leaders sell others on their vision of what the world should be and convince other really smart people, often people with the most highly specialized and sought after hard skills, that they should help make that vision into a reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* &lt;em&gt;While great sales ability can get you really far, it is crucial that the sales is actually based in some sort of reality. Infamous scam artists such as Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos) or Billy McFarland (Fyre Festival) reached the heights of success because of their incredible sales ability. Eventually everything came tumbling down, but there is something to be said about their ability to create billions of dollars in value based on thin air!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Broadly speaking, people’s skills fall into two areas: “hard” skills and “soft” skills.</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How do you think about social responsibility?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/19/how-do-you-think-about-social-responsibility.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How do you think about social responsibility?" /><published>2018-01-19T16:16:56-08:00</published><updated>2018-01-19T16:16:56-08:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2018/01/19/how-do-you-think-about-social-responsibility</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2018/01/19/how-do-you-think-about-social-responsibility.html">&lt;p&gt;How should I live my life? I ask this question a lot because of the following truths:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are a finite number of hours in the day, and therefore a finite number of endeavors I can devote my time to. Giving an idea, like trying to become Instagram-famous, equal weight and equal time as something like finding a job for myself post-graduation would be silly.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I value certain things more than I do others. I don’t love doing everything, and I need a semblance of happiness and fulfillment in my day-to-day.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I am lucky. There’s no denying this! I’m not a starving child in a third-world country, and I wasn’t born with a genetic defect that prevents me from thinking or moving.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Day-to-day, I don’t work on fighting world hunger, climate change, or deforestation. I don’t work on stopping global war, helping our broken public school system, or the AIDS epidemic. And neither do most of my friends or the people I know. From the comfort of Silicon Valley, life can almost seem pretty great.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost easy to ignore the rest of the world from within the Silicon Valley bubble; at Stanford, I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html&quot;&gt;surrounded by privilege&lt;/a&gt; and by working in tech as a software engineer or otherwise, I’ll be working on problems that won’t matter to you at all if, for example, you didn’t have access to clean water (which, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/wash_statistics.html&quot;&gt;according to the CDC&lt;/a&gt;, is over 35% of the world’s population). Of course, you could make the argument that society is trending towards a direction of technology being increasingly important, not the other way around, and that the technologies that you work on will affect the majority of people in one way or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But somehow, that doesn’t seem quite satisfying, because if global warming is getting worse and if 13% of our world is undernourished, then why am I not working on those problems? Why isn’t anyone I know working on those problems? (It is also entirely possible that I do know people who are working on these problems, and that I just don’t know about them/their stories. Feel free to prove me wrong!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to conclude these thoughts by posing a few questions. To anyone reading this, I’d love to know:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What drives you in your current pursuit(s)? Why are you doing what you’re doing?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What do you think about the amount of social responsibility you have for the world around you?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Email me if you have any thoughts. I’d love to hear them.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">How should I live my life? I ask this question a lot because of the following truths:</summary></entry></feed>
