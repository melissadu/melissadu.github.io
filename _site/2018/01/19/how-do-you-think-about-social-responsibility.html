    <p>How should I live my life? I ask this question a lot because of the following truths:</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are a finite number of hours in the day, and therefore a finite number of endeavors I can devote my time to. Giving an idea, like trying to become Instagram-famous, equal weight and equal time as something like finding a job for myself post-graduation would be silly.</li>
  <li>I value certain things more than I do others. I don’t love doing everything, and I need a semblance of happiness and fulfillment in my day-to-day.</li>
  <li>I am lucky. There’s no denying this! I’m not a starving child in a third-world country, and I wasn’t born with a genetic defect that prevents me from thinking or moving.</li>
  <li>Day-to-day, I don’t work on fighting world hunger, climate change, or deforestation. I don’t work on stopping global war, helping our broken public school system, or the AIDS epidemic. And neither do most of my friends or the people I know. From the comfort of Silicon Valley, life can almost seem pretty great.</li>
</ul>

<p>But it’s not.</p>

<p>It’s almost easy to ignore the rest of the world from within the Silicon Valley bubble; at Stanford, I’m <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/01/18/upshot/some-colleges-have-more-students-from-the-top-1-percent-than-the-bottom-60.html">surrounded by privilege</a> and by working in tech as a software engineer or otherwise, I’ll be working on problems that won’t matter to you at all if, for example, you didn’t have access to clean water (which, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/global/wash_statistics.html">according to the CDC</a>, is over 35% of the world’s population). Of course, you could make the argument that society is trending towards a direction of technology being increasingly important, not the other way around, and that the technologies that you work on will affect the majority of people in one way or another.</p>

<p>But somehow, that doesn’t seem quite satisfying, because if global warming is getting worse and if 13% of our world is undernourished, then why am I not working on those problems? Why isn’t anyone I know working on those problems? (It is also entirely possible that I do know people who are working on these problems, and that I just don’t know about them/their stories. Feel free to prove me wrong!)</p>

<p>I want to conclude these thoughts by posing a few questions. To anyone reading this, I’d love to know:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What drives you in your current pursuit(s)? Why are you doing what you’re doing?</li>
  <li>What do you think about the amount of social responsibility you have for the world around you?</li>
</ul>

<p>Email me if you have any thoughts. I’d love to hear them.</p>
