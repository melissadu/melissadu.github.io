When I was younger, airports were my favorite place in the world. They never failed to fill me with a sense of wonder. There were so many people busily running to exotic destinations! How important this place must be. How important these people looked! 

I loved hurrying with my family through the crowded avenues of the airport. I felt like I was part of a team; together we made our way past security, deciphered the confusing flight timecharts, and located the departure gate after meandering past restaurants and ridiculously expensive stores.

My favorite area of the airport was the baggage claim. Scrambling to collect all of my family’s bags while avoiding the countless red herrings the luggage chute threw my way was an exciting game that I was always excited to play. I eagerly checked each of the different suitcases that tumbled out of the chute: no, this bag is not the right color; no, mine has a dent in the top left corner…And when one of my family’s bags eventually did come out, I’d chase after it with glee: here it is, Dad, I’ll get it for us!

Now, as I step off of a 12-hour flight in Beijing, I’m reminded of the child-like awe I felt every time I stepped inside an airport. The feeling of those memories is incredibly at odds with my current mood, however, and it’s hard to retain any sort of glee as I battle long customs lines, intrusive security pat-downs, and incomprehensibly slow lines as I approach the ticket counter to check-in for the next leg of my flight. Instead of admiring the eclectic groups of strangers rushing to their destinations, I now notice how rude people are to each other, pushing and shoving and angrily glaring at their phones. These strangers no longer seem so mystical and important; no, they’re just like me: sleep-deprived because of a 12-hour plane ride in which the stranger in front of them slept in their lap the whole time, cranky because they’re hungry, and impatient because they just can’t wait to leave.

Perhaps growing up means being imbued with a sense of consciousness and understanding about the world the around you. People aren’t so nice after all, and the hustle and bustle of the airport is no longer mystical but draining. I wonder if it’s possible to re-acquire my childhood-like sense of wonder about the world around me. Especially in our world today, in which reprehensible moves are made by the people who theoretically should be the most respectable, I want to hold on to my idea that the world is a beautiful, magical place and look beyond all the faults that I’ve come to know and become so familiar with.

In 2018, I want to remember that our world is a beautiful place. People surprise each other in often the most unfamiliar and beautiful ways. We work together to create intricate systems and groundbreaking technologies. Most importantly, regardless of where I grew up, who I know, or what I believe, I want to remember that I am just as human as any of the other 7.6 billion people on this earth.

My goal is to not forget those things. And I hope that, despite my increasing pessimism, I don’t lose my wonder and awe of the amazing potential we have to work together to create beautiful things.
