I’m always distracted.

The quarter system at Stanford encourages it: ten weeks never feels enough to explore any one subject deeply, and because it is such a short academic period, I always feel like I’m blowing through different subjects. Each quarter is a challenge in context-switching, as time and again I somehow figure out how to balance coding projects and midterms and psets and final papers. 

The way technology is built these days doesn’t help either. I spend time every day mindlessly scrolling through text messages, social media feeds, or email accounts. My phone encourages me to consume high quantities of low quality content. It’s actually difficult for me to read any one article on my phone that takes longer than 5 minutes to complete. After just one or two minutes I feel compelled to either quickly scroll to the bottom of the article, or just switch to a different one altogether.

Throughout Stanford, I’ve always been simultaneously interested in multiple things. I didn’t have a directed interest in my time here, like many of my friends who spent four years playing a sport or working on shows. Instead, I involved myself in a variety of different activities which ostensibly have no connection to each other, besides the fact that I pursued each one solely because I was interested in it. Once I felt that I learned all I could from that organization or pursuit, or more accurately, learned enough to know that I wasn’t interested in pursuing it further, I decided to switch and look for something else. 

So, long story short, I’m still searching for what excites me over long periods of time! I’ve had a few general interests that have remained pretty constant throughout college, but they’re very broad. I’m hoping that as I graduate and actually start working, I’ll be able to better define my interests within the technology and business worlds. In doing so, I hope to better clarify what excites me and find endeavors I can pursue with reckless abandon.
