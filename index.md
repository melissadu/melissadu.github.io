I'm Melissa Du, a recent graduate of Stanford University where I studied Computer Science and History. Prior to college, I spent twelve years of my life [playing violin](https://www.youtube.com/user/asiansarentnerdy) competitively. I currently spend my time as a Product Manager at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com). 

In the past, I've worked as an engineer at Microsoft, Tesla, and Zumper. Feel free to check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdu96/) for a more complete picture of what I've done. 

I'm a fast learner and an avid reader, and I'm still discovering what problem areas excite me the most. These days, I'm thinking a lot about ethics in tech and improving my photography skills.
