[comment] <> (![melissa](/imgs/me1.jpg){: .center-image})

My name is Melissa. I currently work as a Product Manager at [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com), and I recently graduated from Stanford where I studied Computer Science and History. Prior to college, I spent twelve years of my life [playing violin](https://www.youtube.com/user/asiansarentnerdy) competitively. 

In the past, I've worked as an engineer at Microsoft, Tesla, and Zumper. Feel free to check out [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mdu96/) if you're interested in a more complete picture of what I've done. 

I'm a fast learner and an avid reader, and I'm still discovering what excites me the most. These days, I [read a lot](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30668519-melissa-du) and spend time with my friends.
